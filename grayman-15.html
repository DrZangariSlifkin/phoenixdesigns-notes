    <summary class="warn">SPOILERS BELOW (click to reveal)</summary>
    <div class="content">The book opens with a prequel scene set before Court entered Russia in the previous novel, where he kills a bodyguard trying to finish “one last job” for his family.
That man’s father turns out to be Campbell Coyle, a previously unmentioned top-tier assassin known as Whetstone, who becomes the personal antagonist of the story.

Meanwhile, James Arthur Westwood is secretly conspiring with China to eliminate members of the U.S. intelligence community in order to advance his political ambitions toward the Senate and eventually the presidency. China’s involvement is never fully explored or resolved. Multiple assassins are hired to carry out coordinated killings, but Court and his team eliminate all except two: Whetstone and a shadowy figure called Masquerade, who is suspiciously underdeveloped throughout the book.

During the chaos, Zach Hightower is revealed to have an ex-wife and child in witness protection in Boulder, Colorado. His daughter, Andy Delaney, is targeted and used against him, but Court and Zach successfully rescue her - killing the assassin Scott Kincaide AKA Lancer in the process.

The conflict escalates when Whetstone uses Court’s father, Jim Gentry, as leverage, culminating in a confrontation where Whetstone kills Jim in self-defense. Though Whetstone comes to understand the moral symmetry of the “me or him” dynamic and abandons his vendetta, Court does not forgive and pursues him to Ireland. Whetstone confronts him and says he does not want to fight, but will if he must, and they set a final showdown time and place.

Before that can happen, Court learns that Matt Hanley has been critically injured in an attack that also kills CIA DDO Trey Watkins. Meanwhile, a New Hampshire senator is assassinated, but the death is made to look like an accident, conveniently opening a path for Westwood.

At Jim Gentry’s funeral, a mysterious man appears whom Court claims not to recognize, but the reader learns it is his supposedly dead brother, Chance.

The political conspiracy remains unresolved, Hanley is expected to survive, and Court heads to the Charlotte, North Carolina safehouse where Zoya, Zach (injured but recovering), Chris Travers (injured but recovering), the rescued intelligence analyst, and the reporter, King, are staying.

My working theory: Court’s brother Chance faked his death and is actually the assassin Masquerade, setting up a potential brother-versus-brother confrontation in the next book.</div>
